Description: Provides time series datasets for the event detection task.
    Repository for organizing datasets used for developing and
    testing methods for time series events detection. Each dataset will be organized
    as 'list' and a separate documentation about its origin. The repository will
    preferably consist of datasets with labels to assist in evaluating the
    performance of the methods applied in the experiments.
